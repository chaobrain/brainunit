Having dimensions of energy per degree of temperature, the Boltzmann constant has a defined value of $1.380649 × 10^{−23}$ joule per kelvin (K), or $1.380649 × 10^{−16}$ erg per kelvin.

When one of these three is altered for a given mass of gas, at least one of the other two undergoes a change so that the expression $PV/T$ remains constant. The constant, further, is the same for all gases, provided that the mass of gas being compared is one mole, or one molecular weight in grams. For one mole, therefore, $PV/T = R$.\n",
